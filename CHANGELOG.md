# Changelog

Notable changes per release. Check for updates by clicking the version badge
in the app header; update by closing the companion and running
`update_companion.bat`.

## v1.1.0 — 2026-07-14

- **Update checker**: click the version badge in the header to compare your
  install against the latest release; `update_companion.bat` pulls it.
- **Deterministic spell/AA grounding**: the advisor reads the eqlbuilds.com
  dataset snapshot directly (exact unlock levels, AA rank costs) instead of
  scraping wiki tables; spell verification works even without the MCP server.
- **Pet fix**: summoned-pet lines are compared by unlock level — the advisor
  can no longer recommend a lower-level pet than you own (necromancer bug).
- **Typed exaltation sockets**: focus / clicky / worn / proc (taxonomy per
  eqlegendstools.com); socket-move advice is constrained to same-type
  sockets, and proc stones to weapon slots.
- MCP data source repointed to the up-to-date ArtSabintsev repository.

## v1.0.0 — 2026-07-13
